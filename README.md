Click [here](https://matan-daniel-gamedev.itch.io/bowling) to go to itch.io and play the game!  

In this project I created the classic Bowling game.
I took images from google for the lane, ball and created the pin by myself in Blender.
## Scripts
### Ball
1. Ball: responsible for the ball movement, including sound effect when the ball is thrown.

### Pin
1. Hit: responsible for checking whether the pin got hit.

### GameManager
1. GameManager: responsible for checking how many pins got hit, and by that knowing whether to reset the level / remove the hitted pins / move to the next level.

### Pins
1. Strike: responsible to adding sound effect when the ball hit pins.

### Restart
1. Restart: responsible for moving back to level 1 when the game has been completed.
